## POPO — Learning to Build robots in Public

I'm building POPO bot Touch — a tiny emotional desk companion that responds to how you tap/shake it. It's a cube-shaped robot with a screen face, built on ESP32-S3 hardware. This is the first of several small robots I'm planning to create and document here.

I'm not an engineer. I'm learning electronics and embedded systems by building with AI as my learning partner. This site documents that process — the confusion, the breakthroughs, the stuff that broke, and what actually fixed it.

**How POPO bot Touch works:** It responds only to physical interactions (taps and shakes) and maintains internal "pressure" states (rest, social, curiosity, overstimulation) that shift based on how you interact with it. You can't command it — it decides how to respond.

This is **anti-engineer engineering** — making hardware accessible by documenting a beginner's real journey, not cleaned-up tutorials written from an expert perspective.

## What's Here

**[1st Project: POPO bot Touch](/debug/)** — Build log, sensor calibration, things that broke, and what I learned (I am currently here)
