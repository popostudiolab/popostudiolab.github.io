## POPO — Public Working Notes

This is a public working notebook by a beginner, for beginners — exploring desktop companions, ESP32 bots, and AI through **anti-engineer engineering**.

I’m not an engineer. I design and build by learning as I go, working closely with AI as a mentor and partner. Through this process, I’m learning how to do things I never imagined I’d be able to do before — especially in electronics and embedded systems.

I’m documenting POPO as I build it: what breaks, what confuses me, what I try, and what eventually works.

POPO is currently being built as a small ESP32-S3 desktop companion that responds only to simple physical interactions like tapping and shaking. From there, I’m exploring related variants — including a voice-enabled version — as well as other small robots for different contexts, all unified under the idea of POPO as a cute, quiet companion.

The broader idea is simple: to create interactive electronics that can quietly accompany us — on a desk, in a car, or wherever we go — without demanding attention or behaving like tools.

These notes are written primarily for myself. They’re rough, sometimes incomplete, and may fall out of date as the project evolves.

I’m sharing this journey in case it helps anyone else who’s learning, experimenting, or building something similar — especially if you don’t come from an engineering background.
