## POPO — Public Working Notes

Developmental documentation by a beginner, for beginners — exploring desktop companions, ESP32 bots, and AI through **anti-engineer engineering**.
This site is a public working notebook where I document problems I ran into and decisions I made while building POPO.
These notes are written primarily for myself. They may be incomplete, uneven, or out of date.
If you’re learning or building something similar, you may find them useful.

## How this site is organized

- **[debug](/debug/README)** — things that broke and what actually fixed them  
- **[decisions](/decisions/README)** — choices I made and why  
- **[popo](/popo/README)** — what POPO is and how it works
